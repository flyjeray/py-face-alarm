# how to run

rename config_example.json to config.json and paste your telegram bot token there

use run.bat script to open both scripts (just saves time)

### tie to chat

after bot.py starts, run /start to activate bot and tie it to your chat.

It won't retie to another chat until script is restarted.

### control alarm

run /enabled or /disabled commands in Telegram to control alarm.

It won't send images if disabled, but will still save last user in photo.png.
